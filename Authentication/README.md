Lab: Username enumeration via different responses

APPRENTICE

This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:

    Candidate usernames
    Candidate passwords

To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

Lab: Password reset broken logic

APPRENTICE

This lab's password reset functionality is vulnerable. To solve the lab, reset Carlos's password then log in and access his "My account" page.

    Your credentials: wiener:peter
    Victim's username: carlos

```
forgot password -> username= ~wiener~ carlos&new-password-1=test&new-password-2=test

---

```
This lab's two-factor authentication is vulnerable due to its flawed logic. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page.

Your credentials: wiener:peter
Victim's username: carlos

You also have access to the email server to receive your 2FA verification code. 
```

GET /login2

Cookie: session=O6oKDwmJprafDoewXUsAz5SzLKxnLvJ7; verify=wiener

Change the `verify` cookie param from `wiener` to `carlos`. The request for carlos 2FA was made so just trying to BF the MFA ?

```
POST /login2 
mfa-code=XXXX 
```

Run the python script with the arg `-w four_digit_mfa_wordlist.txt`

> Congratulations, you solved the lab!

This lab's two-factor authentication is vulnerable to brute-forcing. You have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code. To solve the lab, brute-force the 2FA code and access Carlos's account page.

Victim's credentials: carlos:montoya 
```

The code uses the Pool class from multiprocessing to distribute the processing of mfa-codes across multiple processes. The number of processes created is equal to the number of CPU cores on the machine, which is obtained using the cpu_count() function. Each mfa-code is processed by the process_mfa_code function, which is run in a separate process. The results of each process are collected in the results list, which is then checked for successful mfa-codes.

```
This lab's two-factor authentication can be bypassed. You have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code. To solve the lab, access Carlos's account page.

Your credentials: wiener:peter
Victim's credentials carlos:montoya
```

Just access Carlos's account page with his creds without validate the 2FA.
