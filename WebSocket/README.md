Lab: Manipulating WebSocket messages to exploit vulnerabilities

APPRENTICE

This online shop has a live chat feature implemented using WebSockets.

Chat messages that you submit are viewed by a support agent in real time.

To solve the lab, use a WebSocket message to trigger an alert() popup in the support agent's browser. 
```

```html
<img src=x onerror=alert(1) />
```
